# SingleStore HTTP Client for PHP
# (singlestore/http-client)

This API allows you to execute SQL statements against a SingleStore database.  It supports all statements that can be run in a direct database connection, and uses conventional data type conversion.

For more information, please visit [https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/http-api.html](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/http-api.html).

## Installation

### Requirements

PHP 7.3 and later.
Should also work with PHP 8.0 but has not been tested.

### Composer

This client is designed to be deployed using Composer.  Since it is hosted at [Packagist](https://packagist.org/), you can use the `composer` command to automatically install it into your project as follows:

```shell
composer require singlestore/http-client
```

Alternatively, you can add the binding manually by editing your project's `composer.json` file:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "singlestore/http-client": "^1.0"
  }
}
```

Then run `composer update` followed by `composer install`.

### ZIP File

If you do not want to use Composer, you can also generate and download the package in a ZIP file using the [php-download.com](php-download.com) website.  Here is a link to the [SingleStore HTTP Client](https://php-download.com/package/singlestore/http-client).

## Example

This package contains an [example.php](example.php) file that explains how to use the SingleStore HTTP Client for PHP.  The instructions at the top explain how to run it.  Included are a basic example and several extended examples.  The basic example will show you how to get started quickly with a few lines of code.  The extended examples build on the basic one and illustrate other API calls and usage.
